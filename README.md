# Refracting Code for Starter Code

## Project Description

I built this project in order to understand the fundamentals of HTMl and CSS. Thruogh this refracting I challenged myself to be fully aware of what semantics I can add without affecting the actual display on the webpage. I had to add semantic tags to help search engines and other user devices to better determine the context of a webpage.  I replaced a number of div elements that were replaced with proper samantics like header,section,and footer tags. I made sure the h1-h6 tags were in order. I also condensed the css page where there was repeated code. I combined the same selector by adding the name given to the selectors that have the same code with commas. Then proceeded to delete the unnecessary code. The problem this solves is to help search engines with other user devices to determine te context of a webpage. I faced challenges with understanding what the acceptance criteria asked of me and and HTML/CSS terms. I plan to continue to review the terms and challenge myself even further. By determining how I can make user devices better determine the context of a webpage.
